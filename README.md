# Time Series Forecasting with Seasonality

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates time series forecasting using seasonal patterns and trend components. The code simulates synthetic data and applies key forecasting techniques using Python libraries like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- Synthetic time series data generation
- Inclusion of trend and seasonality
- Visualization of time series data
- Decomposition of trend and seasonal effects
- Clean and educational structure suitable for learning and experimenting

## ðŸ“Š Techniques Covered

- Trend + Seasonal signal modeling
- Noise injection to simulate real-world scenarios
- Sinusoidal modeling of seasonal patterns
- Line plots using Matplotlib
- Numpy-based array manipulations

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter
